# Desktop Environment Tierlist
<!--(dees nuts)-->
## Used
 - Gnome 40> - Really clean and modern, runs well if you have good hardware, support is amazing
 - Aero - I still use windows deal with it
 - Cinnamon - Old Reliable, really well optimized, runs well on older hardware
 - KDE Plasma - Its all or nothing imo, but its hard to theme and its so picky like wtf
 - Budgie - Ubuntu Budgie ruins it for me, solus is based
 - MATE - 1.26> has made me enjoy it, extensions are mid, but existent. Ubuntu Mate's software boutique is amazing,
 - Gnome <3.38 - Kinda boring now tbh, feels outdated somehow, still reliable
 -  XFCE - Super customizable, literally runs on everything
 - Pantheon - Gotten loads better extremely quickly, limited by imitating MacOS and limited tray and access things imo.
 - Deepin - QT Based, Never used it in the long term but it looks pretty
 - i3wm - hard at first, but once the ricing is finished its cool (never finished configuring it but I have a basic understanding of it)


#### For Old People
 - LXQT / LXLE - Basic, Quick, Wont break, will run on laptops from 2010 (i think and i would hope so)

#### For Smoll Children
 - SOAS - Fedora Sugar Spin is for like 8 y/o 


## Unused
 - UKUI - I think I would like its just hard to install and run
 - DWM - Suckless, more like SuckMORE, (from what ive seen, rices are probably based)
 - AWM - Usually brushed of when i look at it, rices are probably also based
 - Unity - I did not know what linux was in the year 2016
